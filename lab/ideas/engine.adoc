== Engine

=== Check

Calculating a check is quite simple. You need to follow the graph and make sure that every binary condition is well respected.

Heavy optimisation can be done here by doing parallel work and early terminating a compute request when an exact sucess has been found.

The check engine needs to include an explanation feature, like the explain in SQL but for the authorization, explaining which condition has lead to success or failure

=== Subject listing

(what entities can do the permission on the subject, ie : who can read the folder 2 ?)
This is not trivial because we need to find every entity that can do the permission on the subject. If the graph is complexe we might need to follow a lot of routes. Again this can be optimize a lot with clever algorithms.


=== Entity listing

(what subject the entity can do a permission on, ie: what folder can entity 2 read on ?)
This again need some complexe graph logic that can be greatly optimize.
